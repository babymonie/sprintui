![Sprint UI Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/babymonie/sprintui/main/logo.png) - V1

Welcome to the SprintUI framework! We're excited to have you on board. Below is a guide to get you started with building and deploying your projects using this framework.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/babymonie/sprintui/
   cd sprintui
   ```

2. **Understanding the Project Structure**
   - `server.js`: Basic project setup in development mode.
   - `public`: All your public files, including a `pages` folder.
   - `build.js`: Script for production build. After running this, `server.js` is not needed, and routes will point to `index.html`.
   - `pages`: Folder within `public` where your SprintUI project files reside.

## Development Mode

1. Run the server in development mode:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://[host]:[port]` to start building your SprintUI project.

3. For SprintUI syntax, refer to the files in the `pages` folder. It's a mix of HTML and JavaScript. Get familiar with it before moving to production.

## Production Deployment

1. Build your project for production:
   ```bash
   node build.js
   ```

2. After the build, you'll find a new file named `app.build.min.js`.

3. Move `app.build.min.js` to the `public` folder.

4. Open `index.html` in the `public` folder and update the script source to the new build file:
   ```html
   <script src="app.build.min.js"></script>
   ```
5. Finally deploying on a server:
## Deploying on Apache Server

If you're deploying on an Apache server, follow these additional steps to ensure the framework works correctly. Create an `.htaccess` file in your project root directory with the following content:

```apache
RewriteEngine On

# Exclude /assets from the rules
RewriteRule ^assets/ - [L]

# Rewrite all other routes to index.html
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/index\.html$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [L]
```

**Note:** In production, your assets might not load correctly because they are being called from a route called `/assets`, which is not physical. To fix this, create a physical folder and bring all asset files there.

## Deploying with Express Server

If you're using Express for deployment, copy the following code:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("*", (req, res, next) => {
   // Remove this if you want to have a physical route instead of /assets/assets
   if (req.url.includes("assets")) {
    if (
      !fs.existsSync(
        path.join(__dirname, "public", req.url.replace("/assets", ""))
      )
    ) {
      return res.status(404).send("Not found");
    } else {
      return res.sendFile(
        path.join(__dirname, "public", req.url.replace("/assets", ""))
      );
    }
  } else {
    return res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "public", "index.html"));
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

**Note:** Modify the code according to your project structure, and ensure that the necessary packages (`express`, `fs`, and `path`) are installed using `npm install express fs path`. Adjust the port number (`3000` in this example) based on your requirements.


# Learning SprintUI (suip)

Now that you have the basics down, let's delve into using SprintUI (suip) within your project. Follow the steps below to make the most of this powerful framework:

## Adding Styles and Scripts

1. **Linking External Styles and Scripts:**
   ```jsx
   <UseStyles href="https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.css" />
   <!-- Add more links as needed -->
   <UseScript src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com" head={true} />
   ```

2. **Setting Local Styles:**
   ```jsx
   <UseStyles>
     /* Your local styles here */
   </UseStyles>
   ```

3. **Setting HTML and Root Class:**
   ```jsx
   setHtmlClass("bg-gradient-to-r from-[#a6a6a6] to-[#ffffff]");
   setRootClass("h-screen");
   ```

4. **Custom CSS:**
   ```jsx
   <UseStyles>
     /* Your custom CSS here */
   </UseStyles>
   ```

## Query Handling with suip

1. **Query Handling:**
   ```jsx
   let query = useQuery();
   <UseScript>
     document.addEventListener("sprintReady", function () {
       const queryElement = document.getElementById("query");
       if (queryElement) {
         queryElement.innerHTML = JSON.stringify(query) || "";
       }
     });
   </UseScript>
   ```

   ```jsx
   return (
     <!-- Your JSX here -->
   );
   ```

## suip Ready Event

1. **Handling suip Ready Event:**
   ```jsx
   <UseScript head={false}>
     document.addEventListener("sprintReady", function() {
       // Sprint is ready to use, do your stuff here
     });
   </UseScript>
   ```

## SprintUI Page Structure

```jsx
<UseStyles>
  /* Put your CSS here */
</UseStyles>

<UseScript head={false}>
  document.addEventListener("sprintReady", function() {
    // Sprint is ready to use, do your stuff here
  });
</UseScript>

return (
  <!-- Your JSX here -->
);
```

Congratulations! Your SprintUI project is now ready for the world to see. Simply clone the repository, follow the steps, and showcase your creation to the world. Happy coding!

# Customizing Loading and Not Found Pages
In the present version of suip, there is no built-in support for customizing the loading and not found pages. However, you can still achieve this by navigating to your built file, scrolling to the `app.init` section, and modifying the HTML there. Please be aware that I am actively working on a solution that will be available very soon.
## Note on Custom CSS

As of the current version, there is no provision for custom CSS specifically for loading and not found pages. Therefore, you will need to handle the styling and layout manually within the respective functions.

In future versions, the development team aims to enhance the developer experience by providing additional customization options, including the ability to apply custom CSS to loading and not found pages.

Feel free to experiment and get creative with the design of these pages, and stay tuned for future updates that may introduce more customization features.

# Changelogs
go to changelogs.md to see changelogs.

# Upcoming Features

In the upcoming 1.2 update, a new feature will be introduced in the `pages.sui` configuration. This feature allows you to exclude specific files from the build, providing more control over your project. Say goodbye to that test page you don't want in your production buildâ€”simply configure the settings to ignore it. Stay tuned for the release!

# Help Needed

We are actively seeking assistance from individuals who can contribute to adding support for SprintUI. If you have the skills and interest in improving the developer experience with SprintUI, please get in touch with us. Your collaboration will be highly valued.
